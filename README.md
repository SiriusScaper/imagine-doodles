# imagine-doodles
A react app featuring google doodles and the cultures of the countries they feature. This will use a custom API to retrieve the doodles, react, node.js, express.js, mongoDB, and a frontend css framework.


## React App utilizing a custom API to load data from googles doodle site.

This is a full stack MERN app that will allow users to store doodles and make comments on them. The hope is to encourage learning about other cultures around the world.

### Installation

I will assume you have node installed and can run npm.

1.  Clone or download this repo
2.  If you downloaded it, unzip it.
3.  Navigate to the directory location either in a terminal/bash client or your file explorer and opena terminal in that directory.
4.  Then run npm install
5.  Finally after the package dependencies have been installed run the app with npm run dev.

You will also need to have mongoDB setup or use mLab.

### Usage

1.  Pretty straightforward, signup, login and create a profile/comment. (Doodles are WIP)
